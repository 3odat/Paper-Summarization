# **Adaptive Attacks Break Defenses Against Indirect Prompt Injection**


### ✅ **Title:**
**Adaptive Attacks Break Defenses Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM Agents**

### ✅ **Abstract:**
LLM agents leverage external tools to interact with environments, but this exposes them to **Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks**. While several defenses have been proposed to counteract these attacks, their **robustness is questionable against adaptive attacks**. This study evaluates eight defenses and systematically **bypasses all of them** using adaptive attack strategies, demonstrating a **success rate exceeding 50%**. The findings highlight the **need for rigorous adaptive attack testing** to ensure the reliability of defenses in real-world deployments.

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
- **All tested defenses fail against adaptive attacks.**
- **Adaptive attacks remain highly effective (success rates > 50%)** even against advanced defenses.
- **Future defenses should incorporate adaptive attack considerations to improve resilience.**
