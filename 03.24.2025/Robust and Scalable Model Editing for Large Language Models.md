## **2️⃣ Abstract Summary (🔎 Quick Insight)**
> **The paper proposes EREN (Edit models by REading Notes), a robust and scalable model editing method for LLMs.** Unlike existing in-context editing approaches, EREN allows LLMs to prioritize contextual knowledge while maintaining robustness against irrelevant context. The method integrates a **notebook memory system** to efficiently store, retrieve, and apply multiple edits. Empirical results demonstrate **state-of-the-art** performance in question answering (QA) and fact-checking tasks.

---

## **3️⃣ Research Context & Motivation (🧐 Why It Matters?)**
- **🔍 Problem:** LLMs can store vast knowledge but struggle to dynamically update or override incorrect information efficiently.
- **📊 Importance:** Fine-tuning LLMs is expensive and infeasible for quick updates. Existing in-context editing methods lack scalability and robustness.
- **📚 Connection to Prior Work:**
  - **Model Editing:** Prior methods modify model parameters directly (Sinitsin et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2022) but are impractical for black-box LLMs.
  - **In-Context Learning:** LLMs struggle to correctly prioritize contextual knowledge (Si et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023).
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Improves knowledge access but lacks dynamic updating (Karpukhin et al., 2020).

## **4️⃣ Key Contributions (🚀 What’s New & Valuable?)**
✅ **EREN Framework:** Introduces a notebook-based memory storage for scalable in-context model editing.  
✅ **Scalability:** Can handle **thousands of edits** efficiently without degrading LLM performance.  
✅ **Robustness:** Prevents unwanted knowledge overriding by filtering irrelevant edits dynamically.  
✅ **Empirical Performance:** Achieves **higher edit accuracy and behavior preservation** compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

## **5️⃣ Methodology (🛠️ How Did They Do It?)**
- **📝 Approach & Model:** 
  - Uses **two-step inference**: First determines edit relevance, then applies knowledge from memory.
  - Implements **dual-encoder retrieval** to filter relevant memory edits dynamically.
  - Maintains an **editable notebook memory** to store natural text-based edits.

- **🧪 Experimental Setup:**
  - **Tasks:** Question answering (QA) and fact-checking.
  - **Datasets:** CounterFact, FEVER.
  - **Evaluation Metrics:** Edit Success (ES), Behavior Preservation (BP), Edit Quality (EQ).
  - **Baselines:** SERAC (Mitchell et al., 2022), MEND (Mitchell et al., 2022), ROME (Meng et al., 2022).
