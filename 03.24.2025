## üß† Abstract-Level Summary

This paper presents a framework for using ChatGPT in robotics by leveraging prompt engineering and high-level API abstractions. The authors demonstrate that ChatGPT can interpret and execute robotic tasks ranging from basic logic to aerial navigation and manipulation. By integrating free-form dialogue, structured prompting, and code generation, ChatGPT enables non-technical users to control robots through natural language. The authors introduce **PromptCraft**, a collaborative platform for sharing prompting techniques and simulation environments.

## üéØ Research Motivation & Problem Statement

While LLMs like ChatGPT excel in text and code generation, their application in robotics is constrained by the physical world‚Äôs complexity. The main challenge is translating **natural language** into **safe, logical, and executable robotic actions** across diverse platforms. Existing robotics solutions lack flexibility and require technical expertise. This work explores whether ChatGPT can generalize to robotic tasks without fine-tuning, using only prompt engineering.

## üß™ Methodology

The authors propose a **four-stage pipeline** for using ChatGPT in robotics:

1. **Define a High-Level API Library**  
   - Abstracts robot-specific implementations (e.g., `pick_up(object)`).
2. **Design Task-Specific Prompts**  
   - Include function descriptions, environment context, constraints, and examples.
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation**  
   - Users inspect and correct generated code before deployment.
4. **Deploy & Iterate**  
   - Code is executed in simulators or real-world agents, enabling dialog-driven refinement.

> Tools like XML tagging and modular functions further enhance structured interaction.
