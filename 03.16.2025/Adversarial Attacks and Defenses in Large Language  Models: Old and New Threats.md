## 📌 Abstract Summary
This paper explores the **security risks of adversarial attacks** against **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and the **flaws in current defense evaluations**. The authors highlight that:
- **Many defenses are overestimated** in robustness due to improper evaluations.
- An **adversarial arms race** is emerging in **closed-source LLMs** (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard) and **open-source LLMs**.
- **Embedding space attacks** are a **new threat model**, allowing adversaries to bypass filters and generate malicious outputs efficiently.
- The study exposes how **certified defenses fail against advanced attacks**.

## 🎯 Research Objectives & Problem Statement
- **What problem does this paper address?**  
  The **lack of robust defenses** against **adversarial attacks on LLMs**, leading to an **ongoing arms race** between attackers and defenders.
- **Why is this problem important?**  
  Overconfidence in **faulty defenses** could lead to real-world **security breaches** and **malicious content generation**.
- **What are the key research questions?**  
  1️⃣ Why do existing **defense evaluations fail** to provide true robustness?  
  2️⃣ How effective are **embedding space attacks** in bypassing filters?  
  3️⃣ Can adversarial attacks be **mitigated with stronger evaluation benchmarks**?

## 🔬 Methodology
### **1️⃣ Threat Model & Attack Strategies**
- **Adversarial Attacks:** The study reviews **historical adversarial attacks** (e.g., FGSM, PGD) and their impact on LLMs.
- **New Attack Model: Embedding Space Attacks**
  - Attacks target **continuous token embeddings** instead of discrete token inputs.
  - Enables **highly efficient** adversarial content generation with minimal effort.
  - Demonstrates how **open-source models like LLaMA-2-7B** can be manipulated.
- **Circumventing Certified Defenses:** The authors bypass **Kumar et al. (2023)**'s certified defense by removing harmful instructions while keeping adversarial attack sequences intact.

📌 *Key Methodology Figure:*  
![Figure X: Embedding Attack Workflow](./figures/embedding_attack.png)  
🔍 **Figure Explanation:** This figure illustrates how **embedding space attacks** differ from traditional discrete attacks by **modifying token embeddings** instead of actual text input.

## 📊 Results & Findings
- **Adversarial attacks remain highly effective** despite recent defense mechanisms.
- **Embedding space attacks achieve 100% attack success rate** on **LLaMA-2-7B-chat**.
- **Certified defenses fail** when evaluated against **properly structured attacks**.
- **Black-box and transfer attacks** show **high success rates across different LLMs**.

📌 *Key Results Figure:*
