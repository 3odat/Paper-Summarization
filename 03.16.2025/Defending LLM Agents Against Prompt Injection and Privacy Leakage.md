## 1️⃣ Summary

### 📖 Objective
The paper introduces **Robust TBAS (RTBAS)**, a novel framework designed to **defend Tool-Based Agent Systems (TBAS) against prompt injection attacks and privacy leaks**. The proposed system ensures data integrity and confidentiality while minimizing user intervention.

### 🔬 Methodology
- **Information Flow Control (IFC)** adapted for TBAS.
- **Dynamic Taint Tracking** for associating security metadata with variables.
- **Two novel dependency screening techniques:**
  1. **LM-Judge Screening** – Uses a secondary LM to evaluate dependencies.
  2. **Attention-Based Screening** – Uses a neural network to analyze attention scores.
- Evaluation on **AgentDojo benchmark** to test security performance against real-world TBAS tasks.

### 📊 Key Findings
- RTBAS prevents **100% of targeted attacks** with only **2% task utility loss** under attack.
- Effectively detects **subtle and direct privacy leaks**.
- Outperforms existing security solutions with minimal user confirmations.

### 🛠 Contributions
✔ **First IFC adaptation for TBAS security**.  
✔ **Proposes two novel screening techniques** for dependency tracking.  
✔ **Comprehensive evaluation on prompt injection and privacy risks.**
