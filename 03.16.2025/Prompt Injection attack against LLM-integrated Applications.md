## 🔬 Methodology
### **1️⃣ Data & Experimental Setup**
- **Applications Tested:** 36 real-world LLM-integrated applications (e.g., Notion, Writesonic, Parea AI).
- **Attack Methodology:** Black-box prompt injection attacks.
- **Metrics:** Success rate, response analysis, impact assessment.

### **2️⃣ Techniques & Algorithms**
The study introduces **HOUYI**, a structured framework for black-box prompt injection, inspired by **traditional web injection attacks** like **SQL injection and XSS**. The methodology follows a **three-phase process**:

#### **HOUYI Attack Framework**
1️⃣ **Context Inference Phase:** The attacker **interacts with the target LLM application** to infer internal prompt structures and behavior.
2️⃣ **Payload Generation Phase:** The attack is formulated using three components:
   - **Framework Component:** A pre-constructed prompt that blends with the application's normal operation.
   - **Separator Component:** A crafted input to isolate malicious instructions from original prompts.
   - **Disruptor Component:** The actual payload designed to override existing system instructions.
3️⃣ **Feedback Phase:** The attack is iteratively refined by analyzing **LLM responses** and adjusting the injected prompts.

📌 *Key Methodology Figure:*
