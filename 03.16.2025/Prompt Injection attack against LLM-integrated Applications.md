## 📌 Abstract Summary
This paper explores the **security vulnerabilities** of **LLM-integrated applications**, focusing on **prompt injection attacks**. The study introduces **HOUYI**, a novel **black-box prompt injection attack** inspired by web injection techniques (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Through empirical testing on **36 real-world LLM applications**, the study finds that **31 applications** are vulnerable to **prompt injection**, including major vendors like **Notion**. The paper also discusses potential mitigation strategies but highlights that current defenses remain ineffective.
