## 2️⃣ Summary
### **2.1 Abstract Overview**
> This paper investigates prompt injection attacks on LLM-integrated applications. It presents **HOUYI**, a black-box attack inspired by traditional web injection methods, achieving an **86.1% success rate** across 36 applications. The study reveals significant security risks and evaluates countermeasures.

### **2.2 Research Problem**
**What problem is the paper addressing?**  
> The paper addresses **prompt injection attacks**, where adversaries manipulate LLMs via crafted inputs to override predefined instructions, leading to **data leakage, unauthorized command execution, and security breaches**.

### **2.3 Methodology**
**How does the paper approach solving the problem?**  
> The study explores **real-world LLM-integrated applications**, testing **existing prompt injection attacks** and developing a novel approach, **HOUYI**, which uses:
> - **Context Inference:** Understanding application-specific LLM usage.
> - **Injection Prompt Generation:** Constructing attack prompts using framework, separator, and disruptor components.
> - **Feedback Refinement:** Iteratively optimizing injection success.
