## **2️⃣ Abstract Summary (🔎 Quick Insight)**
> **RTBAS (Robust Tool-Based Agent Systems) is a security framework for defending LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks and privacy leaks.** By introducing **information flow control** and **dependency screening mechanisms**, RTBAS selectively executes tool calls while preserving system integrity. The approach utilizes **LM-Judge Screening** and **Attention-Based Screening** to detect and mitigate prompt injections. **Evaluation on the AgentDojo benchmark shows RTBAS prevents all targeted attacks with only 2% loss of task utility.**

## **3️⃣ Research Context & Motivation (🧐 Why It Matters?)**
- **🔍 Problem:** LLM agents using external tools are vulnerable to **prompt injection attacks** that manipulate tool interactions and leak confidential information.
- **📊 Importance:** Traditional safeguards require constant **user confirmations**, leading to fatigue and inefficiencies.
- **📚 Connection to Prior Work:**
  - **Prompt Injection Attacks:** Hijack LM behavior via **malicious prompt embedding**.
  - **Privacy Leaks in TBAS:** Sensitive information can **unintentionally propagate** through tool responses.
  - **Existing Defenses:** OpenAI’s GPTs enforce **manual confirmations**, which are inefficient and burdensome.
